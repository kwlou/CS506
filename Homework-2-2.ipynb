Our server was great since it wasn't his fault and all the other people were waiting on food for a while too. Manager never came by even after the server let him know that out salads came out.

You make a statement like that to me.... and I want to test it out!\\n\\nI can see where Kilroy's got it's name... but does anyone else? I really don't think any of the patrons knows the origin of this restaurant's name. Well... to help my son and anyone else that's halfway interested... here is the Wikipedia origin of Kilroy's... ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilroy_was_here ). I don't think even the future father in law knew the origin of Kilroy's...\\n\\nOnto the food...\\n\\nBleu Burger (*** $8.95) A half pound Burger cooked just right (medium rare) with Blue Cheese topped with a LOAD or Onion Rings with a side of Cole Slaw! The Burger pattie was cooked correctly and it was a half pound AFTER cooking; the Bun lasted throughout the whole meal... but those are the only things positive about this Burger! Blue Cheese was way too mild for this Burger... way too mild... tasted more like a Cream Cheese spread. And the Onion Rings piled on a couple of inches high (at least). Cole Slaw was piled on a leaf of Lettuce - non eventful. A question I have for Kilroy's... Why not serve your Burgers with French Fries by default? Why does a customer have to be charged $1.59 for extra French Fries? To make more money? I just don't see the rationale. \\n\\nThe tradition is to serve Burgers with Fries... not with Onion Rings and Slaw! At least... not where I was raised.\\n\\nCoke (****) Unlimited Refills.\\n\\nService (****) My Coke never saw the bottom of the glass.\\n\\nAtmosphere of Kilroy's is very dated. Movie Posters adorn all the walls of the restaurant. Looks like no current movie posters for a couple of decades... at least. There are small spotlights hung from the ceiling that spots each poster. The right side of the building is a separate bar area... where it's extremely smoky.... seems like the bar area hasn't been aired out in decades.\\n\\nBest Burgers in town... don't think so.\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'This is the first review I have ever written for Yelp!.  And I was compelled to write it because how terrible the food and service at this restaurant was.\\n\\nFirst off, I came in with a party of five and had to wait for 20 minutes to be seated; when we were finally shown to our table, we could see that more than half the tables in the restaurant were empty.  Their explanation:  the kitchen is backed up, so our party had to wait.  I\\'m still trying to make sense out of it.\\n\\nOur waitress was impatient and sarcastic when taking our orders, and seemed to become more frustrated with us when the table ordered only one beer (we had drinks in our room and came just for a bite).\\n\\nAs an appetizer we ordered the Irish style Nachos.  According to the menu it comes with shepard\\'s pie beef, corn, peas, and carrots, chives, and cheddar cheese.  When the platter arrived 30 minutes later, we could easily tell the cheese was the cheap imitation stuff you eat at movie theatres.  We couldn\\'t see any beef on top so we started digging and literally found about 2 teaspoons of some gross bean/beef dip concoction dolloped over a scattering of smashed up tortilla chips.  There was not ONE piece of carrot, corn, or peas on the entire plate.  When I explained to the waitress that this dish was not what we were expecting, she condescendingly explained that, \"yeah.... these are IRISH nachos.\"  No, lady....these were smashed up 7-11 nachos, and there was no way in hell we were paying $10.95 for them.\\n\\nWhen the burgers came, they were just as bad.  My friend noticed the lettuce on his burger looked close to rotten, the buns were soggy, the actual patty didn\\'t taste too bad but was much smaller than you\\'d expect from a restaurant burger.  However, I need to ask, \"what is the point of asking the table how it would like it\\'s burger\\'s cooked if you are going to cook them all well-done?\"  I mean, really, why even go to the trouble of offering a choice if you aren\\'t going to provide it.  \\n\\nAlso, I would have to say french fries come in many variations and many people have different preferences but generally they are pretty hard to screw up.  Well the \"steak fries\" at McFadden\\'s were soggy, undercooked, and a disturbingly pale cream color.\\n\\nThis was probably the worst food I have every spent money on; to top it off the waitress overcharged us with an extra beer.\\n\\nIf you are going to go here for just the drink specials ($10 dollar all you can drink coors lite and well drinks) it might be ok, but STAY AWAY FROM THE FOOD and especially the \"Irish\" Nachos.'},\n",

I really like the fact that they now have a public soda machine so I don't have to go to the counter and ask for a refill which I always thought was the dumbest thing about Wendy's.  Wendy's has improved their food as well.  I really like the Baconator and the son of Baconator.  The new Pretzel bun burgers are pretty good too.  I ordered the Son of Baconator today and with small frries and a drink cost around $7.  Based off the size of the burger and the taste I think it was well worth the price.

By the time I turned the corner the first two cars were gone there was only this annoying black Chrysler whom the whole time was going slow and they didn't have a big order as I saw earlier on the screen before pulling up to give mine so I have no idea why it took them so long to give them their order. Finally after waiting for what felt forever there was a guy and an older lady whom I assume was the one who couldn't punch in a simple order. Anyway the guy took my card didn't ask for ID as I was reading when I pulled up. Like if you are going to have a sign go through with it and be consistent. Not that I think a person would really steal a card and go straight to McDonald's but I digress. He gave me my two bags and two cones literally without a word or eye contact like cmon are you that upset at your lousy yet easy job. It wouldn't kill you to say have a good night thank you. I said thank you and guess what no response. Poorest customer service I've ever seen and it's at night like around 11:15 how could you possibly be so busy you can't say thank you. This location is closer than the one on Boulder highway when you need a bad late night snack but never again this place has not one good decent employee during this visit. Who ever that guy was on duty tonight needs to get some customer service training and the lady needs new ears or a new headset.\"},\n",

During my most recent visit I came in around 12:30 with my laptop to get some work done. When I walked in I was immediately greeted with a warm welcome and I noticed there was only two others in the restaurant eating. When I went to order I made it fairly difficult on the cashier, I was looking for something pescatarian that was around 200 calories that was also gluten free. At most places, my needs are generally impossible. This employee (didn't get his name) gave me several options including customizing things on the menu. I ended up ordering their acai smoothie with a few changes. Before I even sat down and got settled... my order was called... it was fantastic. The smoothie was fantastic, the flavor and consistency was just right. I've had so many smoothies where it's too sweet or too healthy and this one was just right! I hung around for awhile sipping my smoothie and getting work done and before I knew it the place was packed! They definitely have a rush from around 12:30-2 for lunch but they seem to get items out fairly quickly. Since I was there longer than an hour I felt the need to order something additional. I decided to go with the ahi tostada but instead of a tortilla they placed it on a bed of lettuce. Let me tell you, if you are a fan of lettuce wraps and ahi, this dish will blow your mind! For a minute I forgot that I was eating at a fast casual restaurant. \\n\\nLong story short, if you are looking for a healthy and quick spot to grab food that has options for literally everyone, give Greens and Proteins a try.\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'Panda Express is one of the quick serve outlets inside Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa. We intended to use our half-price coupon for the Feast Buffet but were startled to discover a humongous line (Saturday about 11:39).  Do people really wait an hour just to get into a stinking buffet? Are they giving the food away? (No! It\\'s $10 for lunch!)\\n\\nWe made our way to the food court, where you can also choose among Fatburger, Villa Pizza, Starbucks, Ben & Jerry\\'s Ice Cream, Rubio\\'s Fresh Mexican Grill, Capriotti\\'s Sandwich Shop and Tropical Smoothie.  \\n\\nWe wanted no part of Fatburger.  You pay $10 for a meal (more of a snack) that includes a skinny burger similar to the dollar menu at other chains. You get approximately 15 fries.  \\n\\nWe settled on Panda Express. It\\'s marginal Asian-style food, not really good but usually not bad. It vaguely reminds you of eating in an actual Chinese restaurant. It\\'s the kind of choice you make when your original plan goes wrong and the chaotic casino environment jams your brain. It can foul you up even when you\\'re not gambling.\\n\\nThey botched our order and overcharged me. I had a hard time getting them to straighten out the overcharge. I get the impression most Panda employees speak little or no English.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t help that the food court is located in an extremely noisy part of the casino.  It\\'s not surprising they fouled up the order. It\\'s hard to hear anything. Red Rock is vying to be the noisiest casino in Vegas. After a while the hellish din leaves you numb.\\n\\nWhat you do manage to hear is the annoying grating sound the metal chairs make when they scrape against the tile floor.  What genius thought that would be nice?  Every few seconds it\\'s \"screeech! screeech! screech!\" from people moving their chairs.  \\n\\nI say skip the food court unless you enjoy eating in a noisy, stressful environment. I don\\'t know why we didn\\'t go to the Grand Cafe. You can get a decent meal there for about the same money.'},\n",

I hate writing bad or negative reviews especially for a place where the staff was friendly.\\n\\nI was so excited to try them at the Vegas StrEATS festival this past weekend and I had heard that I needed to try the Buffalo Potstickers along with the chicken wings. I wasn't in the mood for wings, especially considering seating was limited and I felt like that would be a mess. So I ordered chicken tenders with the raspberry sweet and spicy sauce and the buffalo potstickers.\\n\\nThey advertise FRESH, NEVER FROZEN right on their sign but the door was open in the back and the cook was definitely pulling chicken and potstickers out of pre-packaged bags from the supermarket. Now, I can't say if they were frozen or not (they looked it) but they definitely were pre-packaged. Was very tempted to go ask for my money back right then and there but decided to wait it out and try the food. (Should have gone with this plan though)\\n\\nThe potstickers were just regular tasting potstickers with sauce poured on top that didn't go together all that well. I ate one and didn't touch anymore. The chicken tenders were tossed in the sauce (by tossed, I mean not even enough sauce to cover each each piece of chicken). The sauce was decent except it was hard to taste it considering the chicken to sauce ratio. Ended up not finishing these either and there were two of us eating them.\\n\\nVery disappointed and I really do hope that I can one day update this review for the better (see: Bachi Burger), but for now, it remains one star and that is only because the staff was friendly.\"},\n",

It\\'s well worth a visit.\\n\\nInside, I was quite surprised that this place was more a Korean restaurant than a Hawaiian joint.  We went with it, and ordered mostly Korean.  They started us out with a good assortment of banchan.  I had the spicy pork and it was delicious.  Spicy, sweet, served on a sizzling hot plate with a boatload of onions.  I had it with a side of mac salad, which was ok.  I\\'ve only had one mac salad that absolutely blew me away, so this was along the lines of most others.  \\n\\nThe kiddo had the kalbi ribs, and from the look of the plate of bones, I think he was pleased.  \\n\\nThe hubby got the jajangmyeon, and said it was delicious as well.  I had never tried this particular dish before our visit here, and it was a little intimidating at first.  Since then, we\\'ve had it a few other times, and this place is one of the best.  The sauce is so flavorful, and the noodles were just right.  \\n\\nA few other dishes on the table were the spam musubi (did not disappoint), and hot stone bibimbap (another solid dish).\\n\\nSo, if you want Hawaiian, they\\'ve got a few basics (spam musubi, kalbi, teriyaki, katsu) but the shining stars here are the Korean dishes.

But the pizza was a disappointment to us. The crust on a large includes about 3 inches on the perimeter with no toppings and some seriously chewy, naked crust. The tomato sauce was sparse and almost tasteless. The mozzarella is the real thing, actual slices which is neat. But why do they put them on the crust before the sauce and the toppings.

I found that to be very sanitary because I imagine other places just pushing out the chunk of ice with bare hands. We waited less than 10 minutes for all our food and headed home.

For this date, the truck was parked on a vacant lot in the desert, near Centennial HS.  Apparently, WBC has a nice following because it was steadily busy the hour or so we were there, with people coming and going.  After a short wait, we ordered two corndogs, one cheese stick (which looked like a corndog), a couple of cold drinks, and the Cajun dipping sauce because they didn't have any Thai peanut curry sauce.  Mustard, ketchup, pickles and jalapenos were also available.  Service was pleasant at ordering and pickup points and they seemed to be cranking orders out as fast as they could.\\n\\nHubby knows a good corndog when he tries one (after all, he's been to the renowned Minnesota State Fair, home to anything deep fried) and he was very happily impressed--so was I. The cornmeal batter created a light crunchy outside, which complimented the slightly sweet breading on the good-sized hot dogs and cheese stick. I usually like a mustard sauce, but once I tried the spiced Cajun sauce on the dog and cheese, I was hooked!\\n\\nIt was a bit dusty, so we ate in the car, people watching and admiring the sunset. We had some dessert, too, as The Candy Bar food truck was also present.  It was a good overall experience for us and we've decided to pencil them in on our calendar every now and then for a mid-week foodie adventure.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"I went to this place tonight after having read a review about it in City Life (one of Las Vegas' local newsletters) and was surprised to find that I had driven past the restaurant at least a dozen times but never noticed it till now.  If you see the exterior, you can probably understand why.  The building the restaurant is housed in looks more like a warehouse or factory than a fine dining place.  When we were about to walk in, my girlfriend asked me if we were gonna get mugged once we opened the door, but surely enough, a wonderful ambiance greeted us.  \\n\\nBoth the exterior and interior walls are made of red bricks.  The tables are definitely artsy, they are shaped like little water color easels, with the easel holes holding the salt and pepper! There are art works by local artists on the alls, in fact, we sat next to a wonderful portrait painting of Oscar Goodman (the city mayor).  \\n\\nOnce we got seated, we took a look at the menu which had so many delicious items that it was hard to know which one to pick exactly.  I ended up picking the Seafood Trio, which had halibut, scallops, and shrimp on top of risotto.  The dish was excellent and was plated beautifully.  In addition, the free bread was tasty (not sure what kind of herbs they had in it but it sure was good) and the lentil soup that I had was a perfect appetizer. \\n\\nI'm definitely glad we found this place, Las Vegas is hardly known for its fine eating outside of the Strip and definitely is not known for any non-chain restaurants.  Tinoco's Bistro is a breath of fresh air in the city; it's also right in the arts district in Las Vegas so be sure to take some time to walk around and visit some of the art galleries and such.\"},\n",

The place only had two tables occupied and we were greeted promptly. \\n\\nThey really made the decor a lot better than previous restaurant - the place used to be Dad's Grilled Cheese which had a 50s/60s feel, and now it is more pleasantly dressed up with curtains and bright colors. They also added a wall so you can't see the kitchen area. \\n\\nI am attaching a pic of my entree, the Snow White omelet - delicious! I love egg white omelets and was thrilled to see I didn't have to pay a buck extra for egg whites like some places. It came with thinly shredded hash browns which were really tasty and unique. I also got a side which I chose cottage cheese. \\n\\nMy friend ordered an omelet which she said was very good also. (I think the western omelet)  I also ordered a to-go meal for my boyfriend, and he ordered corned beef hash and eggs. He said they were delicious. \\n\\nThe only thing I think would make this a more popular choice for me is if they added champagne/mimosas/bloody marys to the menu, we were originally looking for champagne brunch and got tired of looking around. My girlfriends and I love getting a big group together for champagne brunch ... so that's what this place is lacking in my opinion. :-)\\n\\nThe only down side to our visit: we tried to split our bill so that we were paying with two separate credit cards. The waitress understood. Unfortunately... she brings out the credit card receipts and BOTH transactions were rung up on my credit card. She apologized and realized she forgot to clear my credit card info in the machine before swiping the second card. She didn't know how to credit my card and said the owner was the only one who could issue the credit. He just happened to leave not that long ago to make a delivery and she asked if we would mind waiting. Well... we waited for about 15-18 minutes and decided my friend, since she had no cash on her, would just give me the cash when we went to an ATM later. The waitress was very apologetic and I know she didn't do it on purpose, it's just a mistake. I wished we didn't wait as long as we did but we weren't sure how soon the owner would return. Besides, it was a Saturday afternoon and we were wasting valuable pool time!  \\n\\nThe food was excellent, and I will definitely go back. I hope to see mimosas or bloody mary drinks on the menu next time, though!! It's the one thing that I like about Egg Works and I think it would go well at this establishment (owner: hint! hint! get your liquor license)  :-)\"},\n",

My experiences here are NEVER good.  \\n\\nI\\'ve had 2 sandwiches be made incorrectly.  The first time was over a month ago, I ordered a turkey bacon flatbread and got a chicken bacon.  The girl was very kind when I went in and remade my sandwich.  \\n\\nToday was a different story.  I ordered a 6\" turkey bacon avocado on white flatbread with cheese lettuce onion banana peppers pickles olives and ranch.   To start off, the girl who took my order in the drive thru didn\\'t ask me step by step, she took my whole orders. I then moved up to the window and she told me that they are out of white flatbread and asked if I wanted wheat which I said was fine.  I was rung out by a man and because of the interaction with the girl who took my order I wanted to check it.\\n\\nImmediately I knew it was wrong.  There was spinach, tomatoes, green pepper, and mustard.  AND to top it off, it was on white flatbread which I was told they didn\\'t have.  \\n\\nI went inside and told them this.  The female had a lot of tattoos and her ears gauged.  She wasn\\'t concerned with my incorrectly made sandwich one bit.  The man working had to tell her to remake mine first.  She began making it on wheat flatbread and I said \"Do you have white since you made my other sandwich on white?\".  She said \"this is all we have\".  Meanwhile the guy working went and got a bag of frozen white flatbread out for me.  She CONTINUED putting it on the wheat even though he was going to heat up the white for me.  Unbelievable.  He told her to give me a footlong for the inconvenience which was appreciated.  She then made my sandwich and I left.  \\n\\nI am appalled that you have someone working at an organization like this.  Being a food and beverage manager even if I worked at Subway that type of behavior and level of customer service is unacceptable.  \\n\\nShe looked like she was completely miserable.  If she\\'s going to be in customer service she should definitely be in the back of house with her attitude.

Starting at $5.95 for entree of your choice, you choose white or fried rice, and you get an egg roll and an orange slice. It is a lot of food. The last time I dined in, I ordered the broccoli beef with white rice and it was extremely tasty. I was one of the only 2 diners in this place during my whole lunch hour, which I thought was weird but good for me because my food came out quickly. One visit I tried the crab rangoons and they were really good. They had actual pieces of crab in them, yes they were small but many times you order a crab rangoon and there is no crab! This was not the case. 4 delicious cream cheesey rangoons come with a side of sweet sauce for dipping, and they are reasonably priced.\\n\\nBesides food, they boast a large list of milk teas, shaved iced and smoothies with add ins like boba, and red bean. I decided to try the taro smoothie with boba and it was pretty good. I did hear the waitress microwaving the boba in the back so that was a bit odd, but since this isn't a tea house I am sure they just make boba as it is needed. The boba was a good consistency but I found that many of the pieces were still warm. Probably not the best idea to put warm boba in a cold drink. Either way, I will be back to get some cheap lunch.\"},\n",

I mean, I suppose they tried but it didn't even have the poppy seed bun or the fluorescent green relish.  Come on now.  If this review was based solely on that, they probably would only deserve one star.  However, service was quick and friendly, and while the Texas dog wasn't anything to rave over, at least it had some flavor and was a tad bit better than mine was.  I'd suggest skipping it unless you're stumbling across the corridor because you had one too many at Fat Tuesday.  In that case, they should serve you well.\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'Literally one of the best meals I have ever had.\\n\\nImagine this:  4 p.m. local time, family of four has just arrived in town from East Coast.  Husband, wife, and two jet-lagged little kids are looking for somewhere, anywhere to eat an early dinner while driving through the suburban hell that is outer Vegas.  Seriously, there\\'s got to be a good place to eat, but who can tell where to find it among the non-descript strip malls and chain restaurants?  Chinese is usually reliable, right?  Okay, so let\\'s stop at this Little Dumpling place.\\n\\nPull into especially dingy-looking shopping strip.  Husband notices that this is actually Peruvian-Chinese fusion, not just regular Chinese.  He takes the gamble and says the place is probably good.  Wife is too sleep-deprived and hungry to put up a fight.  Looking back, is she ever glad that she let herself get talked into this place.\\n\\nApparently, there was a Chinese population that ended up in Peru sometime after WWII, and as happens pretty much anywhere Chinese people immigrate, they created a fusion cuisine.  As we have \"American Chinese,\" the Peruvians have \"Peruvian Chinese.\"  American Chinese isn\\'t authentic Chinese, but it can be very, very good, so I was open-minded.  \\n\\nWe started with an order of Yuca a la Huancaina, fried strips of yucca (cassava) topped in a very slightly spicy bright-yellow sauce.  The host/waiter/owner\\'s son told me that the sauce was made with peppers and was dairy based, but I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s also got egg yolks in it.  Either way, it\\'s absolutely heavenly.  \\n\\nWe also ordered the Tallarin Chino, or Chinese noodles, topped with vegetables (these are usually made with meat, but they accommodated us).  They\\'re served with a gingery, garlicky black bean sauce and taste much like mei fun or lo mein or those squiggly thin egg noodles that you sometimes get in Thai restaurants.  We also ordered Pescado a lo Macho, which is supposed to be very spicy, but which they made mild for us.  It\\'s a crispy-fried fillet of bass that is served with a tomato-pepper sauce thickened with cornstarch.  Also delicious.\\n\\nLoved the place so much that we went back a week and a half later, just as we were ready to leave town.  I especially love their desserts.  The best was the alfajores, sandwiched butter cookies with a dulce de leche filling.\\n\\nAlso, the Chicha Morada is not to be missed.  It\\'s traditional Peruvian style punch, made with blue corn, pineapple juice, lime juice, and a few other ingredients and is delicious and refreshing.  I believe the traditional way to make this drink is alcoholic, but this version is not.'},\n",

Hot and cold coffees are available, but the cold brew and Midnight Brew (over ice) are the best choices. There's a limited pastry case and menu of fresh salads, flat bread pizzas, and sandwiches, with a refrigerator case of grab and go options. Service over several visits is not the best, frequently have to clarify and repeat basic orders and drinks have a tendency to be underfilled like an inch from the rim- annoying when a large is only 16oz to begin with.\"},\n",

Although it looks rather basic at first glance, the staff is incredibly welcoming and personable. Kim is a very sweet waitress who genuinely cares, and was a pleasure to talk to during our visit.\\n\\nThe menu had just enough choices, including pancakes for breakfast, sandwiches, jerk chicken dishes, and fried fish, just to name a few. The TV wasn\\'t too loud, and the music was very laid back and enjoyable without being overbearing or distracting. \\n\\nMy girlfriend had a turkey sandwich (served with delicious fries!) and a side salad, while I had fried tilapia served with rice and red beans, with mixed veggies. There were very many interesting drinks on the menu (I seem to recall some kind of Jamaican soda, for example.), but I stuck with what I knew and just ordered a bottled coca-cola. I\\'m very interested in trying one of those other drinks next time though!\\n\\nThe food was cooked fresh to order, and my fish was piping hot when it was served! To say it was impressive would be an understatement, for it tasted absolutely delicious for only being a $10.00 or so dish. It was very filling, and had a wonderful \"home-cooked\" feeling, while being a somewhat fresh experience at the same time. Although we couldn\\'t finish it all, we were more than happy to take the rest home with us! Also, as a side note, this place has some rather nice ranch sauce. :p\\n\\nOverall, Coconut Bistro was a refreshing and joyful eating experience, and it was easy on the wallet as well! We felt like family the entire time, and we\\'ll be more than happy to visit again soon. I HIGHLY recommend this place if you\\'re looking for a highly delicious, highly affordable meal. My girlfriend and I are looking forward to visiting again and enjoying this taste of the Caribbean, and we can\\'t wait to try something else on the menu! \\n\\n5/5. Go for it!'},\n",

We also arrived perfect timing because the sun was setting and we had front row seats for that. Furthermore, our waiter, the waiter\\'s assistant, and the server were also awesome. They all had an excellent balance of humor and professionalism. \\n\\nNow the best part, the food. For appetizers, we ordered crispy calamari and shrimp; and crispy Maryland-style crab cakes drizzled with honey mustard dressing. The crab cakes were phenomenal, the crab melts in your mouth. The calamari and shrimp were also delicious. For our main course, my wife had an Alfredo linguini with shrimp and the shrimp had that grilled taste to it, yum! I had the homemade spinach cannelloni filled with ricotta cheese and spinach in a fresh tomato and bechamel sauce. My wife and I normally share our dishes, but the dish I ordered was so appetizing that I did not want to share it (but I did anyway). For dessert, we were full and were going to pass even though their Tiramisu sounded delicious. However, something even better and memorable occurred.

I had never even heard of this place but I am not a frequent visitor of Arizona Charlies. \\n\\nI arrived just as we were being seated in this small, cozy room. The decor was pretty and I loved the fact that the smoke from the casino did not follow me inside. The space is not large, but looks so much like a high priced steakhouse with much better prices. We were offered drinks and I perused the wine list. It was not overly impressive, but I found a tasty cabernet at a very reasonable price so I ordered a glass. I got excited as I noticed that they had a shrimp cocktail appetizer featured. I have been craving an old fashioned shrimp cocktail served in the sundae glass with lots of ice, and the prawns hanging over like the old days when I used to eat out with my parents. I was convinced they would have it.....no dice! The presentation was elegant and came with a shot of clamato juice. The shrimp was tasty and so was the sauce but I was disappointed. I guess I will have to wander into the downtown area to search for my classic shrimp cocktail.I proceeded to order the petite filet mignon with a side of Idaho baked potato and shared a plate of asparagus with a friend. In addition, you have a choice with your entree of soup or salad. I heard the clam chowder as really amazing but I am a salad lover (must be the rabbit in me)...The presentation of the salad was truly artistic as you can see in some of the other featured pictures. The steak was cooked just right and the potato was hot and smothered in butter/sour cream and chives. The asparagus left a little to be desired as they were too large and I like my asparagus stalks thin. They are so much juicier when thin. These are hard to come by and I don't see them too often unless we are in asparagus season. I cannot complain about the service as it was terrific, never had to ask for anything as our servers were right there. The hostess was very sweet and I discovered that my retiring friend is a regular here so we were all treated like royalty. This place was definitely worth checking out and I am glad I did!\"},\n",

They only hold this even on specific days out of the month and it starts very late. Our reservation was for Oct 22, 2011 at 10:30. \\n\\nOnce inside you HAD to pay a mandatory $5 gratuity which was not stated any where on the groupon that right there already pissed me off. You were also handed a drink coupon as mentioned in the groupon. \\n\\nFood:\\n set up around 1 hibachi table buffet style and you just go around and help yourself. \\n\\nTwo models taking turns lying on the table wearing pasty flowers and nude panties with banana leaves covering the appropriate areas. They did have sushi laid on the leaves, but you were not permitted to eat the pieces of sushi off the model. \\n\\n-Sushi: the night started off well with a semi large variety. California rolls, nigiri (salmon, tuna, yellow tail, shrimp)  I think they made the rice portion a little larger than normal. They had some specialty rolls like spider rolls and 2 concoctions that I don't know the name of but were pretty tasty, and spicy tuna rolls. I was able to make about 2 rounds with a pretty decent selection. At round 3 all the nigiri was gone and everything was replaced with California rolls and maybe one plate of spicy tuna. \\n\\n-Sides: EVERYTHING they had as a side that was supposed to be hot was COLD!!!!! gyoza was not crunchy even when I got there just a little after I saw it come out of the kitchen. I didn't try the egg rolls, the shrimp tempura was starting to get a little soggy and was just barely a little past warm. Chicken skewers were awful COLD and dry. They also had a beef side that also was not favorable. \\n\\n-Fried rice: was made fresh. The rice I will have to say tasted like butter. It was so oily and I just felt like I was gaining a pound every time I took a bite. That didn't help the flavor either. I know you need a little bit of fat to make stuff taste good but that was gross. The chef tried to give me a whole scoop but I told him right away to give me 1/2 of that because 1.

We had to ask the hostess after she was done sitting another party where our waiter was. she explained that if we needed any beverages we would have to go to the bar. \\n\\nWATER! don't expect to you get any water during your meal at this event. We went to the bar and asked for water and was told that they were not permitted to give out regular water and they for the night they were only serving bottle water that they were CHARGING you for. If you didn't want to pay for the bottled water you could use your drink coupon for it instead. WTF!! who doesn't serve water at a restaurant?!! They were actually refusing us water. \\n\\n\\nexpect a busser that constantly cleared the table. when I say clear I mean he took: the chop sticks, soy sauce dish, and your wasabi/ginger dish. so every time you came back to your table you had to start all over.\\n\\nI would not recommend going to this event.\"},\n",

I decided to try a slice of Mushroom & Spinach and a Spinach & Cheese stromboli.  I couldn't resist getting only one item, everything looked delicious.\\n\\nThe pizza slice was tasty, the crust was crispy, and all the ingredients tasted fresh.  The cheese was nicely melted and went great with their marinara sauce.  The pizza was great and the stromboli looked even better.  The stromboli was stuffed with spinach and cheese and was paired with a side of marinara.  The stromboli was piping hot and the cheese was gooey and tasted delicious with the spinach.  The dough was crispy, thick, and the texture was just right.  The combination of all the ingredients paired with the marinara dipping sauce made for one of the best stromboli's I've ever tried.\\n\\nI highly suggest trying out this pizzeria if your visiting the Palms.  Every time I'm in Vegas, I make sure to stop by and get one of their stromboli's.  The food is a little greasy, but indulge, nevertheless.\"},\n",

The place looks really cool, like a 50\\'s diner, and is super clean so first appearance was pretty good.  The guy taking our order, who I believe was the manager, lived up to the billing of \"not so friendly\" as he seemed to be incapable of smiling and a bit impatient.  He also asked what name to call out when it was ready and I told him my name.  \\n\\nSo we waited about 10 minutes, then another 10 minutes and then about 25 minutes in (what takes so long to fix some hot dogs and fries??) the guy came out with an order and started calling for Stefanie, which is my wife\\'s name.  My wife asked if I had given her name and I said no.  But then I thought maybe since we had paid for using her card it was our order and sure enough, it was.  Why do they ask for a name to use and then use a name for a card?  Really stupid I think.  Anyways, the guy gave us our order without a word and seemed a bit miffed that he had to call out the name several times (as if it was our fault or something).\\n\\nThe food itself was pretty good, nothing amazing.  The best part was definitely the poutine fries  which were covered in gravy, cheese and were just really good fries.  The food wasn\\'t exactly hot though.  If the fries had been hot I think they\\'d have gone from pretty good to downright awesome but we will never know I suppose.  My wife enjoyed her polish hot dog and I enjoyed my chili cheese dog but again, just average food.  Neither the chili nor the hot dogs were memorable.\\n\\nAll in all this isn\\'t a bad place if you are hungry and nearby, the prices are pretty good but the wait is too long for what you get, the food isn\\'t anything special and the orders seem to come served with a bit of an attitude.  If I was in the same spot again we\\'d probably try Pinks hot dogs instead.'},\n",

       "  'review': 'I recently discovered that this old lunch haunt had relocated to the Clark County Government Center.  (The old location was on Industrial Rd.)  I was so excited to find Expresso King again, and particularly at the thought of being reunited with the Granny Wrap, a chicken wrap with apples and other good stuff.  \\n\\nThe location of the cafe is next to the \"Pyramid Room\" at the end of the building.  Basically, I parked in the guest parking lot, then walked NW in the main hallway, which is sort of curved.  It kinda reminded me of Dorothy following the yellow brick road.  But I digress.  After a 5 minute walk, I found the cafe at the end of the hallway/road.  Upon entering, I saw an empty podium to the right and immediately in front, cooks cooking food like at a diner.  \\n\\nThere wasn\\'t a sign or anything, so my co-workers and I stood there for about 10 minutes waiting to order with the cooks.  Well, come to realize that we needed to order at the cash registers first, which were to the far left of the door we entered in.  We literally stood there for 10-15 minutes.  The cooks didn\\'t say anything, and there were two ladies and a guy near the cash registers.  It wasn\\'t particularly busy, yet no one said anything to us, or even asked us if we needed help.     \\n\\nFinally, I think one of my co-workers noticed the cash registers.  We were then informed that we needed to both order and pay at the registers.  And the people at the registers made it seem like we were inconveniencing them by asking questions!  I suggested that a sign at the entrance would be helpful, especially if no one is at the podium.  The lady just gave me sort of an irritated look and didn\\'t say anything.  \\n\\nAfter that was straightened out, we finally got our food.  The food was just as I remember it - delicious!  I had a wrap (not the Granny) and it was well seasoned and flavorful.  Everyone liked their food, but by the time we ordered and started eating, it had been over an hour and half.  We were not only starving but pressed for time.  While the food was good, we were rushed to eat and get back to work.  So I feel like the food was sullied by the bad service.  \\n\\nAs for the Pyramid Room, it\\'s essentially a giant cafeteria.  It\\'s nice but I kind of felt like I was in high school again.  But there\\'s also a beautiful outdoor amphitheater in the center of the building with benches and grass.  It seems like a nice place to have lunch in the spring or fall.\\n\\nMy tip is to enter the cafe from the Pyramid Room; you\\'ll hit the cash registers first (and therefore, likely avert the issue we had).  I like Espresso King, I really do.  They have weekly lunch specials (http://bepnv.com/site.php?ben_site=7) and are reasonably priced.  I\\'ll probably try it one more time...it\\'s just that I was so disappointed, especially when I recommended it to others.  I\\'m holding out hope that we caught them on a bad day.'},\n",

It's a little bit different from other Korean BBQ were used to in LA because it goes by combos and the waiters cook for you. We're used to AYCE. All the bachan and rice is AYCE though. The owners Jennifer and Ricky really gave us excellent hospitality. Raphael was our waiter for the night and he was very attentive to our needs along with Mac when Raphael was busy.

It is reasonably priced and comes with everything the regular one has, but a couple of additional toppings. Aside from halo halo, they have a variety of desserts to choose from. The ice cream they use is the Magnolia brand, which, if you've ever had it, is so deep in flavor and creamy!\\n\\nIf you've never had Halo Halo before, the toppings alone might look odd, but when mixed in with the shaved ice and milk, they complement each other quite nicely. I wasn't jumping up and down for the jackfruit; it changes the taste of the whole cup. The ube ice cream on top was yummy, but mush it and mix it around so the flavor is evenly distributed through!\\n\\nThe interior is super duper bright which a beachy theme. There is a collage of photos on the wall of customers. There are two tiny tables along the wall. Not an ideal shop to sit in, but thankfully the food court has an abundance of seats.\\n\\nI did have to wait about 5 minutes for my Halo Halo to be made. After all, it has so many ingredients! But the wait was totally worth it. I will definitely be back for more!\"},\n",

Not exactly a `romantic' location w/ all the kitchen crew noise and wait staff traffic.\\n\\nThe service was prompt and very personable. We both ordered the Caesars salad w/ our entree. I asked for a small side of marinara with the bread. I usually do this because I enjoy a dip of marinara with my bread, but more so on a first visit, it lets me evaluate a key ingredient for most of their offerings. We all have formed our own particular tastes when it comes to Italian, and mine was formed during my travels to Italy, in particular Southern Italy. For me their marinara was not bad, but a bit too salty w/ a just hint of tomato. Not that fresh tomato flavor I have grown to love, so I avoided their marinara offerings and went for a vodka sauce dish.\\n\\nThe salads are made to order, I know because we were just steps from the salad chef. The Caesar salad was too 'hot' for both of us. It overpowered all other ingredients. We were later told that it was due to the amount of garlic used. I suggested they try cutting back a bit to give all of the complex flavors of a Caesar salad the opportunity to shine.\\n\\nDinner was good (not great), but we were both pleased w/ out entrees. After dinner we were surprised w/ a complimentary slice of their famous cheesecake. It is not under rated. It was delicious and the highlight of our Off the Strip dining experience.\\n\\nA Tip...

It's kinda large inside so the ambiance isn't that intimate, more Olive Garden then your romantic mom and pop hole in the wall, but that aside, the service was great. Very attentive, quick and the staff was very nice.\\nWe had the calamari for an appetizer. It was nicely done, well presented. Not over cooked and rubbery but tender and delicious. The bread with the olive paste or whatever it was, was good, nothing special but tasty. I had the Chicken Limone - a cream sauce with grilled chicken, sun dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts and pasta. Very good! My date had the chicken parm and she raved that it was one of the best she's had. I will definitely try this place again to sample more of their dishes.\"},\n",

I always come here with my friends at lunch for their pizza buffet.  At 6.99 its more expensive then cici's but you get what you pay for ten times over.  The pizza is covered in high quality toppings and they make a variety of different pizzas all the time to satisfy all different taste buds.  They use a cheese mix on their pizzas that includes provolone and it just adds to the great taste of their pizza.  The garlic knots are great when they are fresh and hot, so if they are old ask for a new order to be placed out there and I've never had a problem with staff accommodating the request.    The salad bar is also included and is not bad for the price, it has all the fixings and dressings that you need to make a good salad but don't fill up!  Another plus is the ability to order pitchers of beer to wash down the meal with.  Enjoy the pizza and bring the family.\"},\n",

Modern decor with a great flow. By the door is a display case with pre made pizzas, various cookie doughs, cheesy bread, and sodas. Then on to the counter where if you don't know what you want, the staff is eagerly waiting to help with suggestions. I got the spicy fennel sausage artisan thin crust pizza. Fresh ingredients, vibrant colors, and great taste made this pizza a hit for me. I like the thought of having to bake my own pizza. Get a pizza in the morning and then put it into your fridge for future use. The timing of cooking the pizza is up to you. The bake it yourself cookies is a perfect compliment to the pizza. A variety of flavors to choose from!\"},\n",

The food (my NY strip and my wife\\'s Cobb salad) were marginal, at best. I was quite surprised, given the prices, which are outrageous for the quality and quantity of the food. The coup de grace for us, however, came just as we were finishing our meal. A bus boy lost control of a tray, spilling empty oyster shells and spaghetti all over my shirt and down my leg. Fine, accidents happen, and I wasn\\'t really angry with him. A manager came out and offered to comp our meal (we let her, of course), but she seemed genuinely angry and surprised that we were upset. She kept repeating (loudly, even, as we were leaving the restaurant), \"It was just an accident.\" Fine. It was an accident. I get that. I don\\'t have to be happy about it, though.

Our server, Lisa, came over almost immediately and took our drink order. I was really disappointed to find the restaurant had no beers on tap, only bottles. We decided to start by sharing a bowl of gumbo. Warning! A $6 bowl of gumbo is quite small and not large enough to share. It did have a good amount of sausage in it considering the size of the bowl. But overall, I found it somewhat bland. It was okay, but disappointing for a New Orleans style restaurant. Being in the mood for Cajun food, I ordered the jambalaya. The portion was quite large. There was ample sausage and New Orleans vegetables in it. Overall, I would rate it as a good jambalaya but not excellent. Again, disappointing for a New Orleans style restaurant.

I love the choices here even though the selection is pretty small.

On-campus food is usually never better than it\\'s \"out of campus\" counterparts! (Let\\'s be honest.) \\n\\nBut their blueberry muffins are one of the best nearby, I recommend that! \\n\\nAlso, their service is pretty good. I have never had a bad experience because they treat their customers pretty well! \\n\\nHUGE TIP: Learn to share your table with strangers; it\\'s college! :)'},\n",

The service and employees is another story.  We ordered our usual last Friday,  11/14/14, and opted for pick up. My husband picked up, and paid by debit. Today,  while going over our bank statement from the previous week I noticed that we were either overcharged, which isn't likely, as my husband knew the total, or someone added a charge after he left. For good service we have no problem leaving a generous tip,  but at this particular location we always encounter rude, disinterested customer service. I've emailed customer service in hopes that a simple mistake was made, and the situation can be remedied.\"},\n",

Friendly, cool and inviting.  The place a has a nice vibe. It looks cool, isn't saturated by smoke yet (which is  a plus) and comfortable. \\n\\nThey have a small stage  that has 2 stripper poles  (1 on each side) of the stage. I am not sure if that was left over from when it used to be a place they held drag queen competitions. ( Or so goes the story I was told). When a band isn't playing they have a large screen tv (above the stage) playing great music along with the music videos. It's a nice mix of music too. \\n\\nThe stage is fairly small but great for a smaller lounge/bar. They have a few couches, a few VIP booth areas and several booths around the edges as well as along couch at the entrance. \\n\\nThe bar along with the rest of the place is a cool vibe and place to hang out. The bartender on both night I was there cam from the Ice House. He books bands etc too. Really good guy. \\n\\nIts a great concept and cool vibe to the place. When I was there they other night I tried the food and was pretty impressed. I didn't expect food that impressive in an area known for dive bars.  \\n\\nThe prices are slightly higher than is typical of the area but I hope they do well since the concept is great.  It is worth checking out and you are just  10 drunken steps to the Double Down to make your evening complete.  Good job Back Door!\\n\\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars  is the sound is weak for a venue  (supposedly) part owned by Dave Navarro. I would expect great sound. It was less than impressive.  The soundboard is behind the stage. Not sure what genius thought of that since  you can't hear correctly or  adjust sound if you are behind the stage.  That is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star review. I am hoping they will fix the sound and I can update my review to 5 stars.\"},\n",

The beef and broccoli is the best I have ever had with fork tender pieces of meat. Their shrimp with lobster sauce, chicken and garlic sauce and General Tso's chicken are also winners. I would just improve on their fried rice. They give you generous portions and it's one of the few places that actually have roast pork egg rolls that are bigger than spring rolls.

       "  'review': 'My husband felt like some fish for dinner, but didn\\'t feel like driving all the way to McCormick and Schmidt, so we tried this restaurant.  The menu is diverse, but as in many suburban restaurants, the reach may exceed their grasp.  He started with the smoked salmon collection -- smoked, peppered, and honey jalapeo.  The peppered and honey jalapeo were fine, but why mess around with a fine smoked fish?  The \"plain\" was very good.  None of them were dry.  I had the cup of lobster bisque.  It was excellent.  Maybe I should have gotten the bowl.  They also offered a chef\\'s treat of salmon spread that was very good.  His Newcastle Ale on tap was excellent and my south Australian white wine was adequate.\\n\\nI have to agree with the previous reviewer.  The sand dabs with green peppercorn sauce, mashed potatoes, and broccolini was excellent.  Unfortunately it was my husband\\'s meal.  I got the trout crusted with pecans, roasted baby potatoes and broccolini.  Fortunately the server put the heavy balsamic sauce on the side.  It was good, but way overpowering.  Unfortunately there were very few pecans on the trout and they were candied, an odd choice for a sweet fish.  Our meal was just over $100 without dessert.\\n\\nAnd the oddest thing happened when we were leaving.  We loved the smoked salmon so much that we wanted to buy some to take home.  Although they have a nice seafood selection in their attached market, there was no smoked salmon to be had.  The only thing they could offer us was an order of smoked salmon to go from their menu.  I really didn\\'t want to pay $14 for tired red onion slivers and capers.  I just wanted to buy some smoked salmon.\\n\\nI wish this restaurant was a bit better, because the menu is intriguing.  But since their prices are comparable, next time we will take the time to drive all the way to McCormick and Schmidt\\'s.'},\n",

I had gone to their website and their prices seemed very, very reasonable. This was one place I really wanted to try on this trip....\\n\\nAtmosphere... despite the Fish Netting hung on the wall and some trinkets from the Seashore... is very Spartan. The restaurant is set in a small Strip Mall. Everything... and I mean EVERYTHING... is served on Paper Plates or Paper Baskets with Plastic Utensils. Kinda cheapens the meal....\\n\\nWhat I ordered...\\n\\nSea Scallop Plate (**** $9.59) Six 2\" diameter x 1\" High succulent breaded Scallops fried to a golden-brown. On a bed a French Fries (****) fried the old-fashioned way... in a Paper Basket. With a side of Coleslaw in a 2\" diameter plastic container... might as well been nothing at all. Loved the Scallops... on a Paper-Basket?!?! Reminds me more of something you\\'d see at a takeout place at a Pier or at the Beach. I have to remind the owners... this is a Sit-Down restaurant!\\n\\nClam Chowder 16oz (*** 1/2 $5.99) Clam Chowder, although very savory and very flavorful... was kinda Watery! Served in a Styrofoam Cup! Tasty, but was cheapened by the Styrofoam! But the Styrofoam goes with the Paper Plates...\\n\\nGot to try...\\n\\nMaine Lobster Roll (**** 1/2 $11.99) I know anything with Lobster is EXPENSIVE... but 1 Penny short of $12.00 is... like... VERY EXPENSIVE! Served on a thin-roll.\\n\\nPulled Pork Sandwich (**** 1/2 $6.99) Very good flavor! But... again... kinda small, if I ordered it.\\n\\nValue (** 1/2) Yeow! This place is for the mini-me kind of Appetite. I would have to order two to three orders just to be satiated... But, that\\'s me, unfortunately.\\n\\nIn Summary: The Subs / Sandwiches are a good value... for Petite-Sized Appetites. When you delve into the Seafood, which is the hallmark of this establishment... that\\'s when things get EXPENSIVE and the Value is almost Non-Existent. (****) for the Average Appetite kind of person. (***) which is definitely not me.\\n\\nBTW, BEFORE you order anything... peruse the daily menu notices located at the front of the order counter. I missed out on, the day I was there... a Pulled Pork Sandwich, a Meat Pie.... you just might like the Daily Menu more than the static menu items.'},\n",

When they bring you the meats you can see how marbled and fresh they are.\\n       - Korean BBQ - Here is the main difference between Korean and Japanese BBQ: Japanese BBQ is primarily unmarinated meats (can be salt/peppered however) that you dip into various sauces. Korean BBQ mostly has marinated meats.\\n**Ordered**\\n       - $19.95 Yagyu Special - Came with the following:\\n              - Harami (Premium Outside Skirt) - My favorite meat. It was the most flavorful and softest of all the meats.\\n              - Rosu (Marbled Rib-eye) - Nicely marbled, but it just lacked flavor.\\n              - Kalbi (Short Ribs) - Tasty like all kalbi. Very delicious. No bones though. Just thick pieces of marinated goodness.\\n       - $9.25 Prime Beef Tongue - Wasn't seasoned as much as we liked when it came. But after we added a bit of salt/pepper, it was just right. It's very tender.\\n       - $6.75 Pork Toro - Like Pork Belly but more meat and less fat. It was a tad chewy after we cooked it, but it was tasty.\\n       - $7.25 Beef Bowl - It came with a salad and miso soup. A pretty good beef bowl and a mighty fine deal.\\n**Recommendations**\\n       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for Japanese BBQ.

But, on the other side of the spectrum, you get a lot of stereotypical suburban middle-class families(you know, the ones with the 9-5 jobs, 2 children and a dog) eat here to save money.\\n\\nThey allow homeless people to eat here. \\n\\nToday, there was a homeless man eating here. He brought his giant bag full of empty soda cans, clothes, and all types of items he had collected in his life.  For the next 40 minutes we had to hear him scream, talk to himself loudly, make loud choking/coughing noises, and to make things worse he constantly kept banging the table with both his fists for no apparent reason. These episodes of punching the table went on for about 30 seconds at a time, and could be heard from outside the restaurant.\\n\\nThe server just decided to abandon the area. He knew that everyone sitting in the 4 tables surrounding the homeless man was gonna be pissed. He accepted the fact that he was not gonna get a tip from any of those guests, and made a decision to not service any of us. \\n\\nThis isn't the worst experience I've had with a host sitting me next to inappropriate people. When I was at the Flamingo in Laughlin, the idiot host sat me next to a group of 6 guys with swastikas tattooed on their foreheads.\\n\\nI'm actually shocked that the bum didn't ask anyone for spare change when waiting in line at the Mongolian BBQ area. I'm gonna give this place an extra star for actually serving Turkey at the carving station instead of possum. I'm also gonna give this place another star for making sure there wasn't a severed toe in the bread pudding.\"},\n",

It is made to order so it takes awhile to cook up but it's worth it. Worth every single calorie and price it cost. But you can just walk around the mall to burn that off. :)\"},\n",

For $11, I expected some mega-chicken and assorted toppings, but there were maybe 9 little cubes of chicken and close to no mango that was promised on the menu. Not cool.

For the grand finale, I always save the best for last was the orange chicken, sadly, I was let down.

       "  'review': 'This is a review about the Village Pubs Restaurants. I am writing in special reference to the Village Pub on Gipson Road in Henderson. I had been going to Village Pubs since the 1970\\'s and loved there food. When I went to the Gipson Village Pub recently I experienced the waitress from HELL!  I was there with my family and we wanted to watch the NBA basketball games on the TV. I first asked the Hispanic waitress to put on the game and she said, \"When I get around to it, you\\'ll get it!\"  After 5-10 min. waiting I went into the bar area and asked the barmaid to change the channel and was informed, \"Your waitress will change it for you!\"  So I sat down and waited and with 2 min. to go in our meal the waitress changed the channel, but it was not the basketball game! (another sport\\'s channel) The waitress kept giving me dirty looks and I decided to speak to the Village Pub  management to find out why we were treated that way. I was informed by Danny (Management) that their pub had a priority to gamblers and  sports fans wanting to watch TV was secondary. I wasnot pleased with that answer and went to Ellis Island Casino the parent company of the Village Pubs. After trying to push my way into their corporate offices to speak to someone in charge I spoke to the new Marketing Manager and was assured she would look into the matter. I am now waiting weeks for an answer, but I hear nothing from Ellis Island Management. I guess I will take my sports dollars to another casino that appreciates their customers. We eat out every night for dinner and we spend a lot of money on food and drink. I guess Ellis Island / Village Pub wants only BIG gamblers and could care less about avid sports fans. GOODBYE VILLAGE PUBS!'},\n",

This is one of the only places in Vegas where I can find actual Honduran cuisine along with lots of other Central American dishes.\\n\\nEven with all the complimentary chips we had, my mom still wanted chips and guac.

The rice and beans were very good though. My mom ordered Chile Relleno. Her plate was HUGE because it also came with rice, beans, and chips. She couldn't finish it all, but she enjoyed everything she did eat. My sister ordered Sopa de Caracol. I didn't sample any of it, but it had such a delicious aroma.

I'm not a fan of zucchini, and I even ate the grilled zucchini that came with it because it was so good. And don't let the name fool you-these are hearty portions of healthy food. This particular meal had three enchiladas, a big scoop of rice, and a huge portion of zucchini. I couldn't even finish it and I'll be saving my third enchilada for dinner tonight. \\nThe customer service was awesome, too. I walked in, gave the girl (I wish I caught her name-she was so nice!) my name, paid and checked to make sure everything was in my bag and left.

House made lemon sake, SO GOOD. So many mind blowing fish we have not heard of, Japanese Kobe beef A11, sea urchin, oyster with house made ponzu, the list goes on. The restaurant is small and simple, we sat at the counter and our sushi chef was very professional, and explained many things about the fish and made the experience very enjoyable.  We got to watch him create everything we were making, and he cut each fish right in front of us which was amazing to watch and enjoy.  They give you the option to have additional pieces that you have ordered as well as a long list of other options you have not sampled.  We added 5 other pieces that did not come on the prefix all were very enjoyable.  I would say this by far is the best sushi experience I have ever had.  Only open for 10 months and already made the top 50 list of Bon Appetite magazines new restaurants and it shows! AMAZING and MIND BLOWING. EXCELLENT JOB.

Also, the waiter seemed to be Viet, the waitress definitely was, the decor and background music was Viet so it all makes eating there a more genuinely Viet experience.  While I was there I noticed all the customers were Asian, and I think most were Viet, so that's a good sign.  \\n\\nNote: They have the best Pho in Vegas but I do prefer Pho in SoCal (Little Saigon, San Gabriel Valley) and Virginia/Falls Church around the Eden Center.\\n\\nSo now Desert Crossing plaza has Nha Trang, Sarfino's Pizzeria & Italian eatery, I-Napa Japanese noodle house and a Subway.  Hopefully Nha Trang and I-Naba draws enough eaters as it's really convenient to have them near my home.  The previous restaurants in those same storefronts didn't seem to last long.\"},\n",

       "  'review': \"This restaurant is the original and last piece in a set of powerhouse French establishments in Las Vegas. After dining at Alize at the Palms and Andres at the Monte Carlo, coming to Andres (the Original) was like, well, coming home. \\n\\nBeing off-strip and closer to downtown gave one a sense of what old Vegas must have been like. At first sight, Andres is a very unassuming house in a quiet neighborhood. After a prompt and friendly greeting, we were shown to our table. The interior was like stepping into maison de la grand-mare (grandma's house). It was warm, inviting, intimate and very cozy. \\n\\nOur menus were handed to us and because we made reservations in advance, they were customized with our names on it. What a nice and personal touch that was! The menu was chock full of French traditional and comfort foods. A surprising and welcome change from all the fusion, eclectic and nouveau selections seem that dominate the Vegas culinary landscape. \\n\\nIf I'd eaten lighter during the day, I would have gone for the 7-course tasting menu. However, I was anxious to try Andre's house specialties. French being my cuisine of choice made ordering decidedly easy. \\n\\nI had the Seared Fois Gras on a lightly sweet, caramelized apple, creme anglaise and aged port wine reduction and my friend, the Melange of Field Greens with a yummy herbed goat cheese, circular cardamom cracker and light balsamic vinaigrette. That really got our appetite going. \\n\\nEven though I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it, I bravely ordered the Lobster Thermador - which has been a staple on their menu for decades. As promised, it was decadent - the full lobster, split down the middle, filled with big chunks of lobster meat and a sublime creme sauce with mushrooms and white wine. I absolutely enjoyed it! \\n\\nMy friend ordered the veal chop, topped with Gruyere cheese and stuffed with the less-salty French ham. He polished off his plate fast! I was able to try a little bite. Though not a fan of veal, I thought the meat was tender and the Chanterelles Veal Jus Madeira sauce was excellent!\\n\\nBecause I saw the dessert cart ahead of time, I opted out my usual souffle. I chose the brulee lemon tart on a shortbread crust.  It came with a raspberry sauce with some fruit and was fabulous. I was happy to see the light texture mirror the lemon curd I make at home. My friend had the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. \\n\\nThis dining experience was fabulous and very memorable. The friendly and attentive staff were definitely the creme de la creme! ;)  Note: I just read that this location will be closing down which saddens me a little.  However, I'll take comfort knowing that its spirit will live on in similar surroundings that will pay homage to the original Andres.\"},\n",

As soon as we walked in, the first thing we experienced was this awkward silence (and smell of warehouse furniture) as if they don\\'t get a lot of people walking in. \\n\\nThe food was okay. Definitely NOT authentic Chinese. More a like a PF Chang\\'s but the quality of Panda Express, which would be fine if it didn\\'t cost $16 for a tiny square plate of beef and black bean sauce or $10 for small plate of vegetarian pan fried noodles. $0.50 cents per bowl for rice and $2.50 a pot for tea. The food wasn\\'t bad and hardly the worst part. \\n\\nThere was only 1 waitress and she was terrible! Spoke little English and even asked us to spell the dish we ordered to her so she can write it correctly on her note pad. When I asked for a bowl of rice, she asked me 3 times what I meant before understanding \"oohh,  a bowl of rice. How many you want?\" When we first got our appetizer, she gave us 2 small dishes to eat the appetizers. About 10 minutes later, the rest of our food came out, and the waitress rushed us to eat our appetizer, pretty much forcing us to finish the last few pieces of our scallion pancakes so she can take the plate. When we finished, I used my side plate to rest all of my utensils on while I ate our other entrees. She came by and made me take my utensils off the side plates so she can take them. Okay.... While we were eating, we noticed that she got food orders wrong, served the wrong table, was clueless to menu items, and rushed people to eat and get out... which, we did as soon as the check was given to us.\\n\\nThe food wasn\\'t bad, but OVERPRICED. You can get the same thing at Panda Express or Pick Up Stix located in the same shopping center. The atmosphere just felt wrong. NOT Chinese at all. This place is owned by a Jewish family with one young Chinese guy playing manager and a random Asian guy with his laptop at the counter who did not talk to anyone. When we were there, we were the ONLY table that were real customers. The rest of the restaurant customers were friends of the owner because they all had Jewish attire and hats on. Even THEY asked for discounts because of the mistakes the waitress kept making.\\n\\nWe were so disappointed, we couldn\\'t stop talking about how terrible the place was for the rest of the week.

They have a list of sauces to add to your meal but they weren't as good as I expected. The sauces are only good for masking the blandness of the meat and fillings.

If you can get past all of that, it is a very fine restaurant and the staff and atmosphere make you feel first class.  The tenderloin beef cubes (which was reasonably priced) was delicious.  The sauteed lobster (which was on the crazy price menu) was not as good and kind of hard to eat.  The fried rice, which comes with the entree was probably the best I've tasted in Las Vegas.

So I stopped in for lunch today (my first time here) I tried searching for some Yelp reviews but found none. \\n\\nThe service: is absolutely perfect. I was greeted by the owners daughter working the register ( Monique?) Maybe I'm not pronouncing it correctly. She was very happy to answer all my questions. I asked how long was this place opened ( less than 2 months ) and I asked about the special of the day ( chicken teriyaki bowl ) so after I ordered my meal I was observing the kitchen and seen the chef in the back cooking on a flat top grille. So I can tell you that the chicken is cook to order. The chef is also the owner (she's a sweet heart) she give me some kimchi she prepared and also she let me try a crab shrimp egg roll and a home made sweet and sour sauce. \\n\\nI know that the heading was service but I had to explain how friendly and professional the owner and her daughter is. In order for you to get the full effect\\n\\nTaste/ flavor: authentic Korean. okay so little bit about me I am into big bold flavors I love the taste of sriracha soy sauce and oyster black bean sauce. Especially when it comes to Asian Cuisine. I didn't expect to see a Teriyaki Bowl what a bunch of vegetables and chicken look so simple. The owner / chef came out and explained her dish to me. Like something you see on the Food Network. She told me that she don't like the flavor of soy sauce to her it's yucky lol. She made the sauce from scratch that was on the Teriyaki Bowl it was very mild but yet flavorful very subtle flavors. But the kimchi was some of the best I ever had very fresh crisp and delicious( I'm not a kimchi fan) the crab shrimp a Eggroll I was telling you about that was on the house was also very good.\\n\\nSorry for the wall of text I am doing this from my phone not my computer\\n\\n\\nOverall very clean environment.\\n\\nMy critique would be that the place is disorganized and a bunch of boxes and stuff laying all over the place. Given they're just moving in but it's been 2 months the place should be more organized. \\n\\n\\nI would give 5 Stars if the place was more organized had some better seating and decor\"},\n",

I then explained how that is impossible with a fryer at 350 degrees considering if you wanted, you could burn the wings. The driver then got upset and did a burn out in front of the house we had the food delivered to and told me to go \"***\" myself.

He gets to work, and we take our seats in the dining area. There was no difference in the outside temperature and inside which made the twenty minute wait a little bit more excruciating.  The pizza comes out and it is shimmering, light reflecting off its greasy shores.  I attempted to take the first slice off of it, and it slips easily off the server, upside down back into the pan. The lack of rise in the bread and grease had made it completely unwieldy. I take a bite out of one of the slices, and it didn't taste so bad, but it was annoying that I had to roll up the slice to be able to hold it.  So what's wrong with this pizza?\\n\\nThe main problem is the crust either needs to be thick or thin.  If it is thin, then it should be crisp in order to maintain the integrity of the slice.  One solution would be to pre-bake the crust rather than sending it into the oven with all the toppings.  Also, leaner pepperoni could reduce the grease.  \\n\\nReally nice guy who appreciated our business, but pizza simply missed the mark.\"},\n",

Enter the new Maple Tree locations (the other is in the south) partnered with Lucky Lounges- breakfast midday for people like us. The bar and kitchen is open 24 hours, but the dining room closes and breakfast menu stops at 11pm. \\n\\nThe BF and I order corned beef hash and eggs benedict. He originally wanted country fried steak but our server came back after a bit to tell us they were out. Then a bit into waiting for our food, we get the news that they are out of potatoes so no hash browns, no country potatoes. What's breakfast without potatoes?! I changed my order to a montecristo and the BF stuck with his eggs benedict with toast instead of the potatoes and a apple fritter. I just couldn't do corned beef hash without the taters. It took more waiting to receive our food, but when it came it hit the spot. \\n\\nI rarely eat Monte Cristos because it is a rich, fried indulgence that can quickly turn into  a hot,soggy, greasy mess. This was crispy and tasty. I like they give you raspberry sauce and maple syrup on the side for it. It came with a side of fruit which was cantaloupe and grapes but it wasn't very fresh. \\n\\nThe BFs eggs benedict was good, with a solid hollandaise sauce. That apple fritter was really good. I love the donut version but never had a fresh made one and it was crisp outside and doughy goodness inside. \\n\\nNow, this visit was obviously pretty rough and I debated if I should just forget about it all together at a point so I think my rating is very generous. The server was really nice, attentive and apologetic for the hiccups. \\n\\nThere was a Yelp check in 15% off so I used that. She didn't tell us she was taking off a discount more than that but we noticed our bill took off nearly one of our meals which I think made up for the rough visit. They did open maybe a few weeks ago and probably haven't figured out their ordering to have enough for each day. And because of having the change our order several times, this breakfast took longer than it should have.

I do have to mention something that really bothered me, my son was apparently followed by a young hispanic man that asked him for $20 dollars, my son politely told the gentleman no and he walked away. Through out the day my son noticed this same man following him through out the casino and it made him nervous, so he walked over by security until the man left. On Friday morning going to pick up my son from the airport these two ladies were standing outside the casino and asked me to give them a ride home and persisted, I had to tell them no about three times, eventually I had to just walk away. I know its a local casino but the security needs to be more alert with the harassment of others. On Saturday night a older black man approached me saying he lost all his money and do I have $20 dollars, mind you while asking me for money he had money hanging out of his front pocket, once I told him no and looked at him with disgust he then went and ask another man by the bar for money, this man set him straight and then came over and checked on me. He was just another guest that was concerned if I was ok, not security!!!!! But to top off the weekend my son was followed again on a different day, so worried again not knowing what was going on he stepped out to the pool area where this man approached him he was security and began to question my son asking him if he is a guest or not, telling my son that he smelt weed. Once my son verified with security that he is a guest by asking his room# and of course my name the security apologized. Where was security when me and my son was approached by strangers asking for money? where was security when two people out front are asking their guest for rides? As far as my room I thought it was nice and fairly priced, but I did wake up on Thursday morning with three small bites on my face and I know it was bed bugs, I hope none caught a ride with me back home, then I will be really upset. My room key was demagnetized, dam near everyday we had to get new keys but that's not a big deal to me. Cant wait to go back again, just please no bed bugs and security please tell the difference between guest and locals. I won a little, keep me playing but nothing to take home.....sad face\\n\\nI do like Silver Sevens and I would come back again. I would like to mention three people but only remember two names. Two servers in the Cafe James, he served us late on Thursday night, awesome guy, called us by our names, laughed and joked with us. Saturday morning at the cafe I think his name was Hector (forgive me if Im wrong) but he also was our server and he was a breath of fresh air, very kind, respectful. The other was one of the waitresses I know her if I see her, but she was the best!!!!!!. I teach customer service and its a big part of any organization or business and Silver Sevens employees the ones that I encountered had great customer service, from check in to check out and all in between.\"},\n",

They didn't have the Vietnamese 3 color dessert I was hoping they carried so I decided to try their pork spring roll patty. Very big mistake. Not only did it not looked appetizing, it looked very bland in color and lacked  the color and vegetables I'm accustomed to in a pork patty spring roll. I took two bites and I was done. The pork patty was old, very tough and overly cooked. I grabbed my Gatorade and took off. This restaurant deserves just a 1 star only because the cashier/waitress was friendly.\"},\n",

I got the lasagna with the side salad, my partner got the chicken Parmesan. The side salad was legit. They gave us a big bowl and we tossed it at our table then plated it. They also give you the dressing and Parmesan cheese in small bowls which is a great perk. You get to add however much you want to your salad! The entrees were both succulent and tender. The reason for my 4 star versus 5 is the waiter. We had to ask 3 different people for our check and repeatedly kept getting passed up.

So, I arrived at 4 (when is was pretty dead), got seated quickly and waited on nicely. Nothing to complain about in the service. Ordered coke (got a large mug) and their \"sampler\" appetizer. This had onion shreds, fried pickles, burnt ends, and some potato skin things. Onion shreds were like all others I\\'ve had, pickles were too--so I have to question if they were frozen. Burnt ends weren\\'t \"real\" burnt ends, just boneless--sometimes pure fat--that have been smoked and slathered in sauce. Good, but not true burnt ends. The potato skin things were decent, but the pork, cheese, and whatnot tasted all the same, so it\\'s kind bland.\\nMy entree was baby-back ribs, brisket, and white meat smoked chicken. I LOVED the wing off the chicken--tender, juicy, flavorful. BUT, the breast meat of the chicken was dry as all hell. Brisket wasn\\'t sliced, and tasted like it had been sitting around. Why not slice brisket? Seriously? Half of it tasted like I was eating tree bark. With the half-rack of ribs, the \"towards the center\" was tender, but low on flavor. The other side \"towards the end\" was pretty tough. There was an overall lack of smoke flavor, and flavor at all, from the ribs. (I sampled ribs at Sprouts--a grocer--and found their ribs to be much better). So a chain focused on their awards on ribs fell pretty short here for me. My sides were macaroni and cheese--which had some cheddar velveta--and rice and beans, which was fine but not great.\\nThey do have sauces on the side, but they\\'re too runny to actually stay on the meat, and while the flavor is good, you can\\'t taste it on the meat as the sauces are too watered down.\\nIn the end, It would have cost me close to $50 for all of this, not including tip, and I just don\\'t see the worth in that. Nothing blew me away.\\n\\nIf you\\'re hard set on this place, go for their chicken wings, burnt ends, and maybe ribs.\\nBut, if you\\'re looking, go somewhere else since you\\'ll get better for your money.'},\n",

       "  'review': \"Fancy sushi isn't my usual go-to dinner option in Vegas; the priority is usually just to take in a number of calories sufficient to withstand what is sure to be a looooong night. However, I couldn't have been happier to stop in, sans reservation, before my husband and I ran off to the Bellagio for 'O'! And I literally mean that we stopped in on a Saturday night...we only had an hour before we had to be upstairs in our room, getting dressed, but saw open tables and decided to stop on whim.\\n\\nThe restaurant is beautiful and classy and I felt underdressed in my jeans and flat-bottomed boots, though the hostesses surprisingly passed on a rather non-judgmental, friendly vibe. No foul; it IS Vegas after all, and anything goes!\\n\\nWe weren't exactly ravenous but knew we needed to eat, so we ordered a small variety. We started with the edamame, which was good...warm and adequately salted. We then ordered one warm plate (Australian lobster and day boat scallop), one specialty roll (Shibuya roll), and one order of sashimi (kanpachi). The best item, hands down, was the lobster & scallop plate...absolutely delicious. The uni butter sauce was savory and full of flavor, and I loved the rice at the bottom of the bowl that had soaked up that yummy sauce. The veggies, lobster, and scallop were all tender and amazing as well. Complaints? Well, for $35 the plate was rather skimpy (pretty small bowl; just two scallops and a few chunks of lobster among the veggies and rice). With that said, it was enough for us since we'd eaten a pretty late lunch. The Shibuya roll was not the best roll I'd had in my life, but was still very tasty and fresh. And the kanpachi (YOUNG yellowtail) was a recommendation from our server; apparently youth gives you a buttery taste. Sooo good...melted in our mouths!\\n\\nI would definitely go back just for that damn uni butter sauce, despite the scant portion of that dish...though not if I were watching my dollars. Definitely a pricey experience, but a great one if you decide to fork up the money. Good service, good food, and the Vegas fine dining experience...pretty awesome.\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'As the months have passed since our last visit to Bombay (which was only days after our first visit), I have to ask, \"Why haven\\'t we been back?\"\\n\\nThe service at Bombay is really top-notch, and I generally find Indian restaurants to be reliable in their warm welcome and swift attention. Bombay exceeded my expectations.\\n\\nWe first visited because, holy moly, an Indian dinner buffet? Really? Game-changer!\\n\\nAlas, that first glimpse of the dinner buffet almost sent me back out the door. Tomato soup? \"Yellow curry?\" Were they trying to court the tourist who might be more comfortable with the idea of \"buffet\" than \"Indian\"? When we peeked under the dishes (almost everything was covered), nothing looked very good, or much like what you see on other Indian buffets.\\n\\nBut, there we were, and parking was a dream (something that keeps me away from my former fave, Tamba), and the fun of going somewhere new is my own catnip. (Plus Indian restaurants always have that clean, cold water like nowhere else. Bombay is no exception. I\\'ve asked for their filtering secret, but waiters just smile and turn away... like girls in a Don McLean song.)\\n\\nWe settled into a big booth and peered at the decor. Hmm, former Chinese restaurant? (Seriously, does anyone know?) I kept staring at a photo mash-up of the Las Vegas Strip and India that suggested if you exit the Venetian just right, you\\'ll step into the Taj Mahal.\\n\\nWe started with samosas. With samosas I want fragrance, slight crispiness, not too much dough, and a spicy filling. Bombay satisfied me with texture and taste plus two fresh-tasting chutneys (mint and tamarind), although I could\\'ve done with a bit more fragrance. (I say that about everyone except Kamal Palace in Long Beach. They ruined me!)\\n\\nOn our second visit we also had paneer pakora. Fine, not too dry, fun to try once.\\n\\nThe list of vegetarian dishes was commendable, but I didn\\'t see my favourite: shahi paneer. I lurve shahi paneer so much that I\\'m thinking of a name change. (Hey, it would only be one consonant, and it might help people finally pronounce my name right.) \\n\\nIndian foodies in the West seem to tend toward healthly eating, so I know this is so uncouth to admit, but I just adore-adore-adore a creamy sauce. Shahi paneer, aka royal paneer, is aptly named in this category.\\n\\nIt\\'s not fair to dock a restaurant because they don\\'t carry one dish. Then I\\'d be no better than those little kids who will only eat chicken nuggets. But, as almost every other Indian place in town (that I like) has shahi paneer, including the little place in the Riviera food court, this wasn\\'t boding well for repeat visits. I like new things, but I also like what I like.\\n\\nAs long as I\\'m making confessions, I\\'m only really happy with an Indian main course if it has paneer in it. I know, I know, that\\'s as terrible as admitting my love of shahi and makhani sauces. Don\\'t misunderstand me, I squeal over aloo and pakora and kofta for sure, but paneer... cheese... that bar is set. Someone open a Wisconsin-Indian fusion restaurant and I will be complete.\\n\\nPaneer dishes at Bombay include palak paneer (alas, the only Indian food I dislike - that\\'s right, I hate cooked spinach - worst poster child for vegetarianism ever, I know), mutter paneer (nice, but can be bland with an overbearing amount of peas), and paneer tikka masala. I went with the last option. \\n\\nThe paneer tikka masala was solid fare, as was the naan (plain and garlic) and rice, although the wording on the menu is a bit unclear over what\\'s included. On each visit, we ended up paying separately for both naan and rice despite the words \"Served hot to eat with bread or rice\" above the list of dishes, which would imply that one is included. This is followed by the somewhat contradictory \"Add $2.00 to make entrees combo served with one Naan/ half rice order.\" We asked, but I have to admit that I\\'m not sure what the server said, other than it sounded like this wasn\\'t available. Hrm.\\n\\nOverall, it comes back to the word \"solid.\" Not \"transportive\" nor \"breathtaking,\" but also not \"iffy\" or \"meh.\" Prices run a little high compared to other area Indian restaurants (Gaylord and Origin excepted) but are right on the mark if not reasonable for the Strip location. To answer my own question, I think we haven\\'t gone back just because there are other places where I can get exactly what I want. But, with the closures of Kohinoor and Saffron - Flavors of India (not to be confused with the Eastside place), Bombay - a \"solid\" 3.5 for me - gets bumped to four stars. \\n\\nOr: 2-star buffet, 3.5-star taste, 4-star menu variety and ambience, and 5-star service and location/parking.'},\n",
